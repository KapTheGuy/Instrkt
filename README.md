# Instrkt
A simple, fast, compiled programming language.

# What
Instrkt is a compiled programming language made for speed, efficiency, and simple-style.

# State
Currently, the language is incomplete, all it does, is whatever is written in the program, it simply prints it. But ofcourse, it's still compiled.
Keep in mind, this only currently works on LINUX systems.
